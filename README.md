## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you're feeling experimental
npm run dev --turbo
```

## Task Descriptions

### Rating Component

We'll be working on a rating component which displays the course rating as a number of stars.

- The component should take the current rating as a prop.
- The component should display that number of stars out of 5, rounded to the nearest 0.5.

### Pagination

We'll be working to add pagination to the course display.

### Review Form

We'll be adding a modal with a review form for the courses. It should submit information to the server. A server only function has been provided to simulate this in `/lib/data.ts`.
